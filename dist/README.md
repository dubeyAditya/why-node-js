# NodeJs 
The code base has snippets for node js event loop and http server.

## Running Event loop ipc demo
* Clone the repo
* Open terminal and run command `node ipc.js`
* Open another terminal and run command `./signal.sh`
* It terminates the node process in first terminal as event loop quits. 

## Running Http Server 
* Open the terminal run command `node server.js`
* This creates a Http server on port 9000 and open it in chrome after 5 seconds.

## Note 
The code is designed on mac and some os specific things wont work like .sh and opeing the browser. You can check the alternatices for your system.
